# haxe-as3-starling-test
A quick test to see if haxe can work with a Starling swc, targeting flash.

It's a haxe openfl project, so to run it you need to...
* Make sure you have haxe and openfl installed
* Edit line 20 of `project.xml` so that it points to your AIR or Flex SDK's airglobal.swc (you can download it at https://helpx.adobe.com/air/kb/archived-air-sdk-version.html )
* In the terminal cd into the top folder
* Type `openfl test flash`

Right now it doesn't work. I just get a black screen.
