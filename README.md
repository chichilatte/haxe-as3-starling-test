haxe-as3-starling-test A quick test to see if haxe can work with a Starling swc, targeting flash.
=================================================================================================

It's a haxe openfl project, so to run it you need to... * Make sure you have
haxe and openfl installed * Edit line 20 of `project.xml` so that it points to
your AIR or Flex SDK's airglobal.swc (you can download it at
https://helpx.adobe.com/air/kb/archived-air-sdk-version.html ) * In the terminal
cd into the top folder * Type `openfl test flash`

Works a treat!
